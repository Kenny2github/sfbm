## Prefix
`=`

## Usage
1. Join a voice channel.
2. `=join <room name> [words per minute] [net? yes or no] [password? yes or no]` - the bot will join your voice channel and connect you to that room. Run `=help join` for more details on the arguments.
3. Send morse code into the channel e.g. `...././.-../.-../---//.--/---/.-./.-../-../..--.`
4. The bot will play back any Morse received from other ends.
5. If you want to change the WPM the bot plays your morse at, send `wpm N` where N is the number.
6. If you want to leave, send `bye`.

This is sort of hyper-QSK because you can receive while you're typing and transmitting as well.
