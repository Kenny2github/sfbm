## Prefix
`.` or `-`

## Usage
1. Join a voice channel.
2. `.join <room or user>` - the bot will join your voice channel and connect you to that room or user.
3. Use your voice activity to key Morse code - best to switch to PTT to use it as your keyer.
4. The bot will play back any Morse received from other ends.
5. If you want to leave, `.leave`

This is sort of hyper-QSK because you can receive while you're keying as well.
