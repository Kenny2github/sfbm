## Usage
1. Join a voice channel.
2. `/join <room name> [net?] [access key?]` - the bot will join your voice channel and connect you to that room.
3. Use the "Text" button on the response to send text to be converted into Morse code; use the "Morse" button to directly type `-- --- .-. ... . / -.-. --- -.. .`; both will be played to all channels connected to your room.
4. The bot will play back any Morse received from other ends.
5. Use the "Leave" button to disconnect the bot from your voice channel.

This is sort of hyper-QSK because you can receive while you're typing and transmitting as well.
